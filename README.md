# Appointment Booking System

This is a side project I made for a friend, called Appointment Booking System (ABS) for a local dental clinic.
Currently, the clinic used manual booking system. To book for an appointment, patient need to come directly to the clinic or call the clinic since there is no online booking system. 
The nurse also need record the appointment manually in a log book, which is very tedious. Hence, this web app is created to provide a seamless appointment booking experience.
